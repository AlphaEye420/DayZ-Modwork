- You may NOT source this app - it is rare that I don't share source, but in this case, I simply spent a lot of time
- I ensure the integrity of my apps' memory usage and always follow strict ethical guidelines for app creation
- This app does not touch your server files unless you export over the top of them, which YOU SHOULD NEVER DO
- ALWAYS WORK FROM A FOLDER THAT IS A NOT USED BY THE SERVER, and back up your server files often
