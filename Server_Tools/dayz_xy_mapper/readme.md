## dAyZ XY mapper 
v 0.0 - A tool for simply visualizing your DayZ mapping from xml and json files
* For now this simply plots a collection of `<pos x y z a />` or `<x, y, z> ` coords on a map instantly, and you can mix the two ways
* Map's pic overlays with a transparency set to reveal the chart behind it
* You can save as (or duplicate sheets) to create your catalog of plots for quick view.
* There is no import export feature, yet.   You need to paste or type in the A column. 
* You can make the table as big as you want
* Edit chart and table formats to suit your needs, _but careful you can mess up the look quickly!_
* Y and A coords there for future plans

TAKES INPUTS:
* "pos" Event XMLs (x= z=)
* "zone" Environment XMLs (x= z=)
* "json" comma delineated coordinates (x,y,z)
* "C/map" space delineated coordinates (x y z)
______
* The Coordinate Converter provided is an easy to use xml<->json map position conversion tool
