## Expansion Trader Zone Tools
_(For Managing your Inventory Stock)_

These Batch Files are for you to use with  your traderzone .json files from inside your profiles/expansion/traderzones folder.

1.Each of the batch files work the same, drag any number of json's from your folder onto the batch file in Window Explorer.

2.Press the key to continue, if no red text errors appeared it's ready to do its work instantly.

### Files:
* **Expansion TraderZone Reset Stock**
  * Overwrites the dragged json(s) to have **ZERO ITEMS**
  * Expansion mod will repopulate your stock on the next server restart
  * Great for Admins performing server wipes  
* **Expansion TraderZone Alphabetize Stock**
  * Overwrites the dragged json(s) to have exactly the same stock but listed in alphabetical order
  * Really helps with finding items for manual stock boosting by server Admins
  * NOTE: You **MUST HAVE sort_stock.ps1** in the same directory as the batch file
