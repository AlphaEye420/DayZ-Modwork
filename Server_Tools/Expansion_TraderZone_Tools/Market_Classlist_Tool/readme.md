## Market Classlist Maker

1. DL or Make: MakeClassList.bat and MakeClassList.ps1 files from the provided code somewhere in your PC folders  
*(name 2 files exactly these names!)*
2. In DayZ\Profiles\ExpansionMod\Market, select all and drag them onto the .bat file

You will get a classlist.txt in the market folder containing all unique types you are selling in your market

You can then use [this app](https://github.com/AlphaEye420/DayZ-Modwork/tree/main/Server_Tools/ClassList_to_XML) to do the same for your types.xml files  
Compare and find what you may be missing in the market
