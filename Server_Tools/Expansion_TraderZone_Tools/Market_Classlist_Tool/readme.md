## Market Classlist Maker

1. DL or Make a MakeClassList.bat and MakeClassList.ps1 file out of these somewhere in your PC folders  (name 2 files exactly these names!)
2. In DayZ\Profiles\ExpansMod\Market, select all and drag them onto the .bat file

You will get a class list of all of what you are selling on in your market.

You can then use [this app](https://github.com/AlphaEye420/DayZ-Modwork/tree/main/Server_Tools/ClassList_to_XML) to do the same for you types.xml files to compare what you may be missing in the market items.
