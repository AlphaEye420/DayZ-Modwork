# DayZ-Modwork
Drops containing .c .map .xml .json for various DayZ mods

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TAKE AND USE ANYTHING. There is nothing proprietary of mine or others here.  Most of the items are used on my server.  I'll continue to drop items here (that won't give away my server's motives) that I find could be helpful to the DayZ modding community.

I WORK WITH DEER ISLE MAP.  

The latest versions at time of most recent dump: 
DayZ v1.21
DeerIsle 5.1
DayZ Expansion v8.21
