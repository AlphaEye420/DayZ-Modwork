### Weather Report for DayZ 1.26
This is a continuation of the work started by affenb3rt - big thanks to him!

SERVER SIDE ONLY!
Simply copy the @WeatherReport folder to your server and add to servermod= 
No need to repack and make your players have it on their machines.

It will create a file called Weather.json in your profiles folder. 

The json is self explanatory, just remember that the notifications will say the names you have in the weather condition.
