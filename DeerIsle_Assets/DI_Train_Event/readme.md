## Train Dynamic Events For Deer Isle
* Like the ChernarusPlus map, they will dynamically spawn loot and zombies
* Copy/paste this folder's items into your files
* Create cfgeventgroups.xml if you don't see it in the missions folder
* Events & Cfgeventaspawns nominal/min smin/smax dmin/dmax should match 
  * _(default is 2min-2max, 0-2 or 1-2 is a possible change if you want to make it)_
  * DO NOT change the values inside the cfgeventgroups
  * Instead for any new builds, rotate using the a="" in cfgeventspawns as that rotates the whole train (zero your "a" by 294 is a train heading south)


So far there two trains done, more will be added and these files will update as I go.
