## Train Dynamic Events For Deer Isle
* Like the ChernarusPlus map, they will dynamically spawn loot and zombies
* Copy/paste this folder's items into your files
* Create cfgeventgroups.xml if you don't see it in the missions folder
* Events & Cfgeventaspawns nominal/min smin/smax dmin/dmax should match 
  * _(default is 2min-2max, 0-2 or 1-2 is a possible change if you want to make it)_
  * DO NOT change the values inside the cfgeventgroups
  * Instead for any new builds, rotate using the a="" in cfgeventspawns as that rotates the whole train


So far there two trains done, more will be added and these files will update as I go.

* `Train #1   Train_Abandoned_Cherno`
  * _(x="4234.33" y="8.12" z="10735.1" a="335")_
  * On the northeast side of the rail bridge NE of Sandy Bay 
  * This is a short derailed cherno-map train edited to fit DeerIsle
  * Contains standard train loot
* `Train #2   Train_Abandoned_DeerIsle`
  * _(x="4706.3" y="20.5" z="6055.7" a="0")_
  * In the middle of the map on the rails halfway between Sunset Cross and Westbrook
  * Made from scratch - set to look abandoned while still on course 
  * Can be used in future locations for a long straight section of rails
  * Contains a mix of Standard, Industrial, and Military loot 
  * This is long train and the zombies only spanw near the front (west end), so you may want to spawn your own zombie area at the rear or middle
