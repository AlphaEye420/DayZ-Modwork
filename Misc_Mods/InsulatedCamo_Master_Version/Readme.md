## InsulatedCamo
by AlphaEye
### Features
* Insulation Levels for all styles of maps - _each camo has gear combos in each level of insulation_
* Specialty Stats for SOME items - _i.e. added/removed insulation, waterproofing, lighter weight_
* Bags have increased inventory capacity
* 14 Skins each with 32 items + bonus 3 skins of boots
* As an extension of vanilla gear, this is an extremely small mod at 14MB

**Server Owners Repacking:** 

This pbo was made prior to splitting up the mod into 1 pbo per skin.  DO NOT USE THIS PBO WITH ANY OTHER INSULATED CAMO PBO - THIS IS AN ALL-IN-ONE PBO!  The advantage to using this version is if you plan on using ALL skins, the admin tools list is more manageable.

_On the steam page, skins are broken up into .pbo's so you can add only the skins you want in a repack.  You MUST have the base pbo (InsulatedCamo_base.pbo) for any of the skin pbo's to work!_

Do what you want with this mod.  The .paa textiles are all pictures that are available in a Google Search, and all objects and meshes are vanilla.

### IMPORTANT:
The original [BlackOps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2311093275) mod inspired this one, and I have added a lot to the skins, changed some on screen names, but I kept the attributes. You can "upgrade" from that mod because I kept the names of the types.xml the same, so if you remove that mod and install this one before you start the server again, players won't lose any gear.

### Change Log
* v1 Released up to Camo7 (built from a template)
* v2 Added camo8-13 (expanded template)
* v3 Added many pieces of gear to fill out insulation levels
	* Modified stats of gear to find balance and not over-buff
	* Rewrote the mod to remove template and separate files and folders
	* Reworked camo textures to be streamlined and more homogeneous from item to item within a skin
	* Made two versions - The main mod is now split into skin.pbos - Master all-in-one on github
