## InsulatedCamo
by AlphaEye
### Features
* Insulation Levels for all styles of maps - _each camo has gear combos in each level of insulation_
* Specialty Stats for SOME items - _i.e. added/removed insulation, waterproofing, lighter weight_
* Bags have increased inventory capacity
* 14 Skins each with 32 items + bonus 3 skins of boots
* As an extension of vanilla gear, this is an extremely small mod at 14MB

**Server Owners Repacking:** Skins are broken up into .pbo's so you can add only the skins you want in a repack.  You MUST have the base pbo (InsulatedCamo.pbo which contains the boots) for any of the skin pbo's to work!  Do what you want with this mod.  The .paa textiles are all pictures that are available in a Google Search, and all objects and meshes are vanilla.

NOTE: Due to using separated pbos for skins, the list of items will show up sorted by camo#.  Should you want to have them appear in admin list sorted by item type, AND you intend to use all of the skins, then you can find a better ALL in 1 pbo on my github.  If you repack the master list mod, do not use the individual pbos from this mod.
